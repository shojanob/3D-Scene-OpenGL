# 3D-Scene-OpenGL

Throughout the 3D Scene Final Project, my approach to designing software involved working systematically from a simple foundation—starting with basic shapes and gradually building up complexity by layering textures, lighting, and object transformations. This project helped me craft new design skills such as modular scene construction, efficient resource loading (textures and shaders), and balancing visual aesthetics with technical structure. I followed a design process rooted in iteration: first building rough prototypes to test object placement and functionality, then refining their appearance, materials, and interactions based on the project rubric and visual testing. This incremental, layered tactic is something I can apply to future projects to ensure smoother progress and early identification of design flaws.

When developing programs, I focused on modularization—breaking complex scenes into reusable methods like RenderMouseObject() or SetupSceneLights(), which made debugging and enhancements much easier. A new development strategy I used was refining my shaders and lighting dynamically while viewing the scene, which helped me understand how ambient, diffuse, and specular components interact in real time. Iteration played a crucial role; at each stage, I continuously refined object placement, camera control, lighting intensity, and texture scaling to improve the realism and coherence of the scene. Over the milestones, my coding approach evolved from "one big block of code" into modular, reusable, cleanly commented structures that reflect real-world development standards.

Computer science plays a direct role in reaching my goals by giving me the technical foundation to bring abstract ideas to life through code and visualization. Computational graphics and visualization, in particular, gave me new knowledge about how 3D environments are constructed—from fundamental object modeling to advanced concepts like lighting physics and shader programming. These skills will directly support my future educational pathway by giving me a strong starting point for learning advanced game engines like Unity or Unreal, and professionally, they open doors into fields such as game development, VR/AR systems, and scientific/medical visualization, where creating clear, interactive 3D scenes is critical.
